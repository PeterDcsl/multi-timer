## What is this?

A desktop app written in C#, which allows you to run multiple timers independently, as well as name each timer. The time on each timer can also be manually overwritten any time the timer is not active. 

Useful for tracking time for work timesheets, or any other situation where multiple things need timing. 

## Requirements

- .NET 5
- Windows (although would likely be trivial to get working with Linux)
